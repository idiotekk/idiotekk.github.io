This is a brief note for the course "build python web apps with flask" from [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).

# Django vs Flask?
- Django Full-stack web framework that follows the batteries-included approach.
- Flask is more light-weight but as powerful when fully utilized.

# Front-end vs back-end
Front-end of a website 
- consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and static assets.
Back-end 
- is largely storing, accessing and manipulating data.
- it often has an API to intereact through HTTP requests and responses.

# Stack?
> The collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application is referred to as a _stack_ 

Two set of stacks:
- MEAN stack: Mongo.DB, Expresss.js, Angular JS, and Node.js
- LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP

# HTTP?
Stands for **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol.

# jinja2?
Jinja2 is the [template engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) of flask.
It's a cool name.. sounds like "ninja".
