# The next hype?


# Metaverse
I believe under the hood, it's not something brand new; at the same time it is not a scam (like some people said "it's just application of VR")
rather it is a continuation of what we had dreamed about the internet since the last century.

With the technology of blockchain, one can securely *own* something on the internet.
What's different from that we own a facebook account or an asset in a video game:
- the ownership is recognized by the whole web (which is largely Ethereum ATM which invented the NFT standard), not just a local network or a propriatory database
- it is not controlled by any single person or entity, that can delete/block your account, annihalate your ownership for no reason -- that is, once you own something, it is *final*, and recorded in the blockchain and never can be erased
- it is secure, guranteed by the mathematics behind the blockchain. No worries about losing your asset during a transaction

The infrastructure for the metaverse is still in infancy.
- Opensea, the largest NFG market place is still barely better than garbage, not to mention others.
- Bridges are needed to connect everything into a single network. The current "verse" is still fragmented into many chains with limited connection in between.
