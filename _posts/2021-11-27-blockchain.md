# ETC

When opening the website of [ethereum classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/), I couldn't help saying to myself ["what a piece of junk"](https://youtu.be/Mrx24jofi0w). It looks like a website forgotten by its owners -- out-fashioned design, invalid links, rare updates with little new information... Why is it even ranked 35th on the crypto marketcap chart? Some token behind it look much more competitive in many ways -- sandbox for instance (I'll come back to this later). The only reason why ETC is stil there is that it used to be one with the current blockchain queen, ETH.

I'm sure ETC will die out and be forgotten, maybe not in the near term, not in the next year, but in ten years, it will be gone. leaving only a tomestone in people's memory. That is, unless there is miracle and somebody has the power to revive it -- but who bothers? What can you do on ETC, if you have a much advanced version: ETH (which is already outdated technology compared to Polkadot and others).

# BCH

[BCH](https://bitcoincash.org/) on the other hand looks a bit better-maintained although still looks like a pretty much dead website. That might be more understandable than ETC -- BCH like BTC is supposed to be "dead" -- they are like a piece of truth written somewhere on a slate; people are not supposed to change them, unlike ETH/ETC that is a "living" technology and need to keep up with the worlds needs. ETH/ETC are supposed to become faster, bigger and friendlier, while BTC and BCH are supposed to be as they are.

* * *

Should you buy ETC and BCH? Okay to buy because: 1. they have chance to double since there are some interests in them; 2. they are dying but the near term downside is not large. 

But there are better choices than them.

# SAND

This is the 3rd investment in my life that went 10x. I liked it from first sight -- it has a style of the minecraft, a style that is so classic that is never outdated (just like lego, coke, doraemon...), a style that is crude meanwhile highly refined. It was something that I liked to have even if it would not go up.

# DOT/KSM

To my surprise many projects that already onboarded on Kusama are still in a very very early stage. Bit.country for example only has a few poor demos that look far less competent sandbox or decentralland. (Let's say I won't have any appitite for the project based on such demos.) Maybe that's my false expecation, and they are supposed to be like that. After all, Kusama is supposed to be early-stage, explorative and experimental, less mature than Polkadot. 

On the other hand that's a good thing - they still have good upside potentil possibly. No investment value once everything is highly refined and mature.

# Next hype

The key to prosper in the blockchain world is to front-run a hype and hold through it. What is the next hype?
The next bull market will come before 2024 for sure, likely 1 year before that (because smart investor like to front run news).
Let's see what are the options:
- Defi: This is an area that's ever growing, but has not caught attention for a while. Likely the next hot topic.
- Game & metaverse: A hype is ongoing. Not a good time to buy right now, but keep an eye on good projects to prepare for next.
- Social network: a very new idea not seen in many blockchains, much related to metaverse. Subsocial from Kusama network for example might be something big in the future. Meta will play a role here? 
- Relay chain: other than Polkadot, hard to tell, worth digging.
- Meme coins: a tricky regime, but there are 100x or 1000x oppotunities. Doge and Shiba Inu are gone oppotunities. Dogelon Mars might be good after maybe tanking 1 or 2 more months.
