Why do I learn css?
Answer: it is part of an effort to know what is going on under the hood of each webpage.

And occasionally, I need to write css myself. I have built a shiny app, and had to modify a bloc of css code that I had no clue how it works. I copied from goolge and try my best to modify it without knowing the syntax of css. It was painful. And I realize that I'd be happy if I understand something like that.

# what is css
Cascade style sheet.

# basic examples

- define rules for a tag, for example, `p`:
```
p {
    font-family: Arial;
}```
- define rules for a class, which will be used like `<p class="bold">`:
```
p.bold { 
    font-weight: bold;
}```
If we define `.bold` instead of `p.bold`, then in html `classe="bold"` is not limited to `<p>`.
- define rules for an id, while will be used like `<h1 id="chapter2>`:
```
#chapter2 {
    color: green;
}
```
- `color red !important;` will override everything in case of confliction.
