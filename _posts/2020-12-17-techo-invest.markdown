If 30 years ago somebody was asked what this world would be like in 2020, and tried his/her best to predict, then he/she would very likely completely wrong. Well, of course one could say that there are still about as many countries in the world as there were 30 years ago, and people still work as hard as they did, and there are many other aspects that this world is pretty much the same. But our life has fundamentally changed, thanks to the advances of technologies. During this 30 years, many companies grew from startups into giants, to name a few most notable ones: Facebook, Amazon, Google.. And if the world is going in a similar pace in the next one or two decades, which will very likely be the case, in 2040 we will see new tech giants that do not yet exist today or is still small.

What this means to an investor is that there will be many potential oppotunities in the tech sector. And if one is wise enough (or, lucky enough) to jump on the right boat, one can easily 10x his investment. To see how big the potential is, here is how many times the stock prices of some tech giants have grown, based on [google finance](https://www.google.com/finance):

- FB: IPO for 38 in 2012, now 276, 7 times in 8 years
- AMZN: IPO for 1.73 in 1997, now 3200, 1850 times in 23 years
- GOOG: IPO for 54 in 2004, now 1730, 32 times in 16 years
- AAPL: IPO for 0.16 in 1980, 0.30 in 1990, now 127, 400 times in 30 years
- MSFT: IPO for 0.1 in 1986, 0.65 in 1990, now 220, 340 times in 30 years

Of course there were a number of super-stars in the past that went wrong and fell, to name a few: 

- AOL: declined because of the dial-up is replaced by brandband.
- AltaVista: once the most popular search engine, bought and sold several times but no one had a clue how to monetize it. It was later superceded by Google which was faster, smarter and offered better user experience. AltaVista had powerfull and cool way to [write queries](http://jkorpela.fi/altavista/), but an average internet user would never bother going that far. Bought by Yahoo and was closed in 2003.
- Myspace: still exists, but only a music site. It was once an oppoent of Facebook, but failed because of bad user experience.
- Netscape: once the only competitor of Internet Explorer (now both are history). Firefox was born out of it.

Most of these companies failed because they were unable to keep up with the advances of technologies, or their products did not fit market well. See more company failures at [failory.com](https://www.failory.com/cemetery). So one does not simply invest in a tech companiess and hold for 10 years, and 10x his/her money. Work needs to be done to do the right investment!

What are the industries that expect significant growth in the next decades? Let's look at the holding of [ARKK](https://ark-funds.com/arkk), an ETF that invests in tech sector: 
1. TSLA, new energy vechicle
2. ROKU, streaming
3. CRSP, gene-editing
4. SQ, electric payment
5. NVTA, gene testing
6. TDOC, telemedicine
7. Z, online real-estate
8. PRLB, 3d printing
9. SPOT, audio streaming
10. PSTG, clouding computing

These basically represent the hottest trends in technologies: gene techonology, EV, telemedicine, cloud computing/storage. 

# new energy
Projection of electricity generation by source: [click here](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/images/AEO2020_infographic_2.png). By 2050, the electricity generated by new energy will be triple the amount now, and solar will consist half of it. From the plot it is safe to conclude that solar energy is the fastest growing sector of the new energy industry.

## impact of new presidentcy 
Here comes a new president that supports the development of clean energy. In particular the official [site](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) mentions that he will make far-reaching investment in the following
- infrastructure: a broad term that every president aims to do, not very informative
- auto industry: importantly including EV industry; all US-built buses be 0-emission by 2030; 
- transportation: 0-emission public transport, like e-bus (noteable), light rail (not sure how much this can go)
- power sector: pollution-free power sector by *2035* -- pretty ambitious to me
- agriculture: climate-smart agriculture, which I can relate to e-tractors off my head
