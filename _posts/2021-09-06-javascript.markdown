This is a brief note for the course "Introduction to JavaScript" on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

# What is [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
Much similar to python, JavaScript is 
- high-level: highly abstracted
- dynamic typing: a variable can be changed to any type

JavaScript, together with html and css, is the core of Wordl Wide Web. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages.

# Standard built-in objects
See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).
Example of usage of built-in objects:
```javascript
Math.random();
Number.ceil();
String.prototype.repeat();
console.log("this is a message") 
```
# Key word for variable decleration
`const` and `let`; the latter allows later change of the declared variable. They are availabe asof [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

# Truthy and falsy
Similar to how python turns a variable to bool. The following are "falsy", otherwise "truthy":
```
0, '', undefined, null, NaN`
```
