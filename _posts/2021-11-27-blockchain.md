# ETC

When opening the website of [ethereum classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/), I couldn't help saying to myself ["what a piece of junk"](https://youtu.be/Mrx24jofi0w). It looks like a website forgotten by its owners - out-fashioned design, invalid links, rare updates with little new information... Why is even ranked 35th on the crypto marketcap chart? Some coins behind it look much more competitive in many ways -- sandbox for instance (I'll come back to this later). The only reason why ETC is stil there is that it used to be one with the current blockchain queen, ETH.

I'm sure ETC will die out and be forgotten, maybe not in the near term, not in the next year, but in ten years it will be gone. leaving a tomestone in people's memory. That is, unless there is miracle and somebody has the power to revive it -- but who bothers? What can you do on ETC, if you have a much advanced version ETH (which is already outdated technology compared to new comers).
