This article is one of a series about some random facts/thoughts on C++.

# Why do I learn C++
- For work.
- C++ is a lower-level language. Learning it makes me understand better how machine works, which is helpful for higher-level languages too.
- C++ is a good skill to have. It is one of the most popular and mature language, one can do many things with existing libraies and with the wide community support.

# Virtual function

Why do we need virtual function?? I have no clue just by looking at the definition.

# What the m_ ?
`m_` is a prefix for class **m**embers. Not syntactically mandatory but widely accepted convention.
```cpp
class A
{
    private m_value;
}
```

# Disable a function by =delete
```cpp
Class ABC{
 Int d;
 Public:
  ABC& operator= (const ABC& obj) =delete;
};
```
# [delete[]](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/new/operator%20delete[]/) vs delete
They are different operators. `delete[]` is for deleting arrays, `delete` for other cases. 
[Why do we even need `delete[]`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/252830/10437558)
```cpp
int* set = new int[100];
// do stuff
delete [] set;
```

# Dot dot dot...?
`...` means [unknown number of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function#In_C++).
It is seen in most popular languages, however not so strightforward in cpp as in python/R.

# Initialization
# How shall I initialize a variable?
Four kinds of initialization:
```cpp
int x; # strictly speaking this is not a "initialization" because the varible is not initialized
int x = 5; # copy initialization
int x(5); # direct initialization
int x{ 5 }; # init in braces; if putting nonthing in {}, the variable is set to 0.
```
The last one is favored because it does not silently convert the input if the input has the wrong type. For example `int(4.5)` will silently converts `4.5` to `4`, losing the decimal part `.5`, while `int{4.5}` won't compile. We never like data lost without being known.

# Expression, statement, expression statement
Basically expresion = result; statement = action. Expression statement is both (it is a statement by definition), but the "result" is discarded.
```
x = 2
```
Suffixing it with an `;` makes it a expression statement.

# You can't define a fuction inside another function
Unlike many other languages.

# main() should return 0 to indicate it runs successfully
Where `0` is [exit status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status).
Other two standard status: `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE`.

# boolean variable take one byte to store
Not one **bit**, because the minimal indivisible storage unit is 1 byte.

# unsigned intergeers are evil. leave them alone
For example, subtracting a signed from an unsigned can give weird result, becuase the signed is converted to unsigned.

# Functional pointer
When to use them: 
- Point to callback functions (functions that are arguments of other functions).
- Looks like 

It is essentially the C way to [Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
> A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
