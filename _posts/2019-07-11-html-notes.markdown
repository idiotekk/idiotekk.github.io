Why do I learn html?
Answer: it is part of an effort to know what is going on under the hood of each webpage.
And occasionally, I need to write html myself.
First of all, [this](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) will be super useful.

# simply put
, enclose text by `<tag> </tag>` here `tag` could be:
- `p` for paragraph
- `h1`, `h2`, ... for head, number indicating depth (or level)
- `ul` for unordered list, `ol` for ordered list; and `li` for list item
- `a` for achor, may have `href` linking to website, or bookmark like `#Chapter1`, or internal pages
- and so on

*except for*

- `<br>` which does not close with a `</br>`.
- self-closing tags where the `/` can be ommitted
    - <img src=... />
