Why do I learn Java?
Answer: out of curiosity.

This post serves as a learning note.

# Access modifiers
Modifiers defines the scope of accissibility
- `public`: unlimited access
- `private`: accessible within class
- `protected`: in package and subclass
- `default`: within package

# math operators
`+-*/a%` do what they literaly mean and `++,--` similarly to C++.

# string methods
--which is important because programming is all about numbers and string, after all
`length, concat, indexOf, charAt, equals, substring, toUpperCase, toLowerCase`
do what they literally mean.
## remarks
- `indexOf` can find (first occurance) of a substring
- `concat` does not change original string; neither do `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase`
