If you click on this article because of the title, you'll be disappointed. This article is not (only) about immutable and hashable objects in python. 
The reason is that I was struck by something else at the moment I started writing.


I belives most people know the famous question:
> If a tree falls in a forest...

I came up with a similar question for python:
If a value gets destroyed and no name is referring to it, does it make a sound?

Well, values do not make a sound anyways. I guess the real question is, how do we know the value is destroyed if it is no longer referenced?
