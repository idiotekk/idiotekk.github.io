There is no need to emphasize that 2020 was an extra-ordinary year, during which, the world changed a lot, so did I. I experienced sad things, had some little thoughts and experiments about life, and at the same time, make a fortune by luck and courage. 

## highlights 
In the middle of the year, I had the thought to become a musician, full-time or part-time, and took action towards it. But now I am not too serious about that, the reason is that I think compared to becoming a musician, it looks more promising and important to first realize financial freedom, after which, I can do whatever exciting with lower risk. That being said, I never regret picking up a bass and make progress on it, which is a rewarding and unique experience. Maybe someday I will become professional on that, who knows?

In the last month, I ventured to write some fiction. I have 0 expectation on that, and rather than regarding it as "writing", I would prefer to think of it as an exercise to think -- about the world, about future and about myself and friendship. I won't be disappointed whatever the outcome is (even if I decide to stop it for some reason), because the process of writing itself is inspiring and exciting.

## takeaways (or: what I learnt from 2020)
- fortune does not fall from the sky when you sit there and watch, you have to take action, and very likely take risk too, to earn it
- stay healthy, stay happy, and work for yourself, play the long game. 

I've reached a point in my life where new year resolution is no longer a big thing to do. Nevertheless, it is good to think about what to do during the coming year, and beyond, becuase you know, choice is more important than hardwork.  
## roadmap of this year

- make progress on my work
- keep learning, keep learning, keep learning. A person that stops learning is a walking dead. And what to learn:
    - technology. In particular, programming
    - *the world*. keep an eye on what is going on, and think about the underlying logic
    - investment. In particular fundamental investment because that is the only thing I can do
    - and everything (if time permits): music, history, psychology, ...
- reach 1m networth -- not super hard to do, takes a little bit work and luck.
