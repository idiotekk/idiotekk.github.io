Why do I learn css?

Answer: it is part of an effort to know what is going on under the hood of each webpage.

And occasionally, I need to write css code myself. I have built web app using `shiny` library in R, and to achieve certain color-coding effects I had to modify a block of css code that I had no clue how it works. I copied from goolge and try my best to modify it without knowing the syntax of css. It was painful. And I realize that I'd be happier and better off if I understand something like that. 

And to get the understanding, I'd better learn the basics in a systematic way, rather than reading a block of complicated css code, and look up everything I do not understand.

It is similar to the process of learning a natural language, say Italian: it is very inefficient to grab a Italian newspaper and try to look up every word you see, when you do not know Italian at all.

# what is css
Cascade style sheet.

# basic examples

- define rules for a tag, for example, `p`:

        p {
            font-family: Arial;
        }
- define rules for a class, which will be used like `<p class="bold">`:

        p.bold { 
            font-weight: bold;
        }
If we define `.bold` instead of `p.bold`, then in html `classe="bold"` is not limited to `<p>`.
- define rules for an id, while will be used like `<h1 id="chapter2>`:

        #chapter2 {
            color: green;
        }
- `color red !important;` will override everything in case of confliction.

# the box
- box model explained by a image, from [geekforgeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/)
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/box-model-1.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
- space of the box
    - `padding` defines the space between text and border; more specific variables are `padding-top`, etc.
    - `margin` defines the space between border and the boundary of the page (or containter); comes with `margin-top`, etc.
    - both `padding` and `margin` can be specified in one line, clock-wise for top, right, bottom, left; for example

            p {
                padding: 1px 2px;
                /* padding: 1px 2px 3px 4px; */
                /* padding: 1px auto; */ /* auto for entering; must comes with width defined */
            }

# Topography
Fonts are important, because it influence how you feel when reading the text.

In css, font-related properties are specified by `font-family,font-size,font-weight`, their meaning self-explained.
Spacing of text defined by `line-height,letter-space`, etc.
