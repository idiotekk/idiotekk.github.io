If 30 years ago somebody was asked what this world would be like in 2020, and tried his/her best to prediction, then he/she would very like completely wrong. Well, there are still about as many countries in the world as 30 years ago, and people still work as hard as they did. But our life has fundamentally changed, because of the progress of technologies. During this 30 years, many companies grew from startups into giants, to name a few most notable ones: Facebook, Amazon, Google.. And if the world is going in a similar pace in the next one or two decades, which will very likely be the case, in 2040 we will see new giants that do not yet exist today or is still small.
