If 30 years ago somebody was asked what this world would be like in 2020, and tried his/her best to predict, then he/she would very likely completely wrong. Well, of course one could say that there are still about as many countries in the world as there were 30 years ago, and people still work as hard as they did, and there are many other aspects that this world is pretty much the same. But our life has fundamentally changed, because of the progress of technologies. During this 30 years, many companies grew from startups into giants, to name a few most notable ones: Facebook, Amazon, Google.. And if the world is going in a similar pace in the next one or two decades, which will very likely be the case, in 2040 we will see new tech giants that do not yet exist today or is still small.

What this means to an investor is that there will be many potential oppotunities in the tech sector. And if one is wise enough (or, lucky enough) to jump on the right boat, one can easily 10x his investment. To see how big the potential is, here is how many times the stock prices of some tech giants have grown, based on [google finance](https://www.google.com/finance)
 - FB: IPO at 38 in 2012, now 276, 7 times in 8 years
 - AMZN: IPO at 1.73 in 1997, now 3200, 1850 times in 23 years
 - GOOG: IPO at 54 in 2004, now 1730, 32 times in 16 years
