# The next hype?


# Metaverse
I believe under the hood, it's not something brand new; at the same time it is not a scam (like some people said "it's just application of VR")
rather it is a continuation of what we had dreamed about the internet since the last century.

With the technology of blockchain, one can securely *own* something on the internet.
What's different from that we own a facebook account or an asset in a video game:
- the ownership is recognized by the whole web (which is largely Ethereum ATM which invented the NFT standard), not just a local network or a propriatory database
- it is not controlled by any single person or entity, that can delete/block your account, annihalate your ownership for no reason -- that is, once you own something, it is *final*, and recorded in the blockchain and never can be erased
- it is secure, guranteed by the mathematics behind the blockchain. No worries about losing your asset during a transaction

The infrastructure for the metaverse is still in infancy.
- Opensea, the largest NFG market place is still barely better than garbage, not to mention others.
- Bridges are needed to connect everything into a single network. The current "verse" is still fragmented into many chains with limited connection in between.

# Defi 2.0
Defi 2.0 has been a thing for a long time - at least one year. It was widely noticed in Q4 of 2021, I only looked into it recently.
The central concept is protocol-owned-liquidity, which solves the lack of liquidity problem for dexes. Basically that means the protocol provides its own liquidity instead of users providing liquidity pairs.
Defi 2.0 protocols are often suffixed with "DAO", I don't know why (of source I know what DAO stands for but...); and they typically offer crazy high APY - in their native token not in USD.
Out of all the Defi 2.0 portocols I have looked into two: Olympus DAO is the pioneer launched on ETH, Rome DAO is a fork with extra features lauched in the DotSama ecosystem. I'd say, they are highly experimental and it is still yet to prove itself a sustainable model, but it is worth a bet.

In the long term, several scenarios may or may not happen:
1. Price of the native token sustains while APY remains high, early joiners get rich - this can only happen if the protocol experience exponential growth, which is unlikely sustainable.
2. Price of the native token drops, and converge towards 1 dollar (which is the theoretical "intrinsic value").
3. APY drops to a few percent which is barely better than putting USD into bank. Price of native token stays.

I choose ROME because it's the next-generation of Olympus (not necessarily better but offers something orthogonal and innovative) and still has the early-joiner rewards now, at this early stage.
