Why do I learn css?
Answer: it is part of an effort to know what is going on under the hood of each webpage.

And occasionally, I need to write css myself. I have built a shiny app, and had to modify a bloc of css code that I had no clue how it works. I copied from goolge and try my best to modify it without knowing the syntax of css. It was painful. And I realize that I'd be happy if I understand something like that.

# what is css
Cascade style sheet.

# basic examples

```
p {
    font-family: Arial;
}

.bold {
    font-weight: bold;
}

#chapter2 {
    color: green;
}
```
To apply above css, do
`<p id="chapter2", class="bold">
