# What is SQL?
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) stands for standard query language. It is a language for handling [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) (a database based on the relational model of data). 

# How to write it
The essentials of SQL are quite easy to learn because its similarity to natural language, and IMO it is easier if you happen to know `data.table` in `R`.
Basically this summarizes how it works
```
        WITH table1 AS (
            SELECT col1, col2
            FROM table2
        )
        SELECT 
        col1 as col1_alias,
        col2,
        SUM(col2)
        FROM table1
        JOIN
        table3
        ON table1.col2 = table3.col3
        WHERE col4 > 10
        GROUP BY col5
        ORDER BY col6
```
